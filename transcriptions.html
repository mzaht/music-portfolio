                <h2>Charles Mingus</h2>
                <p>Might be the hardest piece I have transcribed so far, where the total piece is about 9 minutes long. This piece features a lot of time changes, ranging from straightforward swing, 6/8 afro-cuban, 3/4 uptempo swing, and a ballad-feel. I adapted this piece for a 4-horn jazz combo from the big band recording on the internet. It was perfect for the combo aswell since we had doublers for most instruments including flugelhorn, alto saxophone, soprano saxophone, and bari saxophone.</p>

                <h2>Curtis Fuller</h2>
                <p>This transciption comes from Curtis Fuller's album, Sliding Easy, featuring his sextet. This arrangement features a short intro to start it off then it goes on with the alto sax/trumpet (depending on who your lead player is) playing the melody first, followed by the trombone playing it with backgrounds with tenor sax. It gives room for solos and is then followed with a one chorus soli/shout chorus for the horns, giving some contrast in the piece's form. It was a great piece to transcribe since there are a lot of harmonies present, meaning I had to pay careful attention to what each horn was playing. Aside from that it was a great tune to work on with the combo since there was a lot that we had to listen to aside from the traditional lead sheets we played off of.  </p>
