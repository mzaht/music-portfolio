            <p>Mike Morales is a passionate jazz musician/composer from San Rafael, California. Currently a junior at San Rafael High School, Mike is actively involved in the school's jazz band, but also takes on the role as the student director of the jazz combo. With a strong interest in music theory and arrangement, Mike enjoys arranging jazz standards into big band pieces, creating pieces in his own style, but also crafts original pieces. Outside of school, they continue to pursue their love for music by actively seeking gigs, playing in local bands, and exploring different genres to expand their repertoire. Mike believes that jazz is a great way to express yourself, as he has done with jazz improvisation, but is also a great way to share his vision that jazz should be accesible to everyone, no matter their background. </p>
